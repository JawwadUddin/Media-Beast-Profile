# Media Beast Profile

This project is a recreation of a design file for a profile page given to me by Media Beast. Since the aim of the project is to replicate the UI designs as close as possible, and add responsiveness where necessary, some functionality has been omitted (e.g button clicks).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install the dependancies and simply start the server.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Key Features

- Project built using NextJS
- Rendering content using SSR
- Tailwind + Custom styling
- Custom font
- Responsiveness
- Additional custom home page


### Future Improvements

- **Toggle Light/Dark Mode:** Implement a toggle for switching the theme.
- **Backend:** Implement a backend to bring back profile data instead of using dummy data.
- **Functionality:** Connect links, enable watching shorts, etc.
